# Portfolio
Hosted: liamganose.com

This is the code for my basic portfolio app built using Elixir's Phoenix, Typescript and React.
I'm a back-end developer so I took a lot of inspiration from jakeherp's portfolio (https://github.com/jakeherp/portfolio).
I used this in part to develop my Elixir and Typescript skills but also to serve as landing page for all my work/skills.
